# Asteroids - Classic Arcade Game Rbuilt
This is a modern remake of the classic Asteroids arcade game, built using Python 3 and PyGame. It demonstrates core game development concepts like game loops, collision detection, object spawning, and event handling. Perfectly suited as a backend engineering showcase with a focus on logic and architecture rather than visuals.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
- PyGame â€“ for game rendering, input handling, and timing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can verify by running:
```bash
python3 --version
```

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/stichj/Asteroids.git 
cd Asteroids
```

2.  Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Game

```bash
python main.py
```

Use the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` to navigate and `spacebar` to shoot. Avoid or destroy asteroids to survive!

## Features

-   Asteroid generation and movement
    
-   Spaceship controls and shooting
    
-   Collision detection
    
-   Modular, extensible architecture
